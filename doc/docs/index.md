# What is TrailDB?

TrailDB is an efficient tool for storing and querying series of events,
in other words, things that happen over time. The series of events
could be generated by a user using a mobile application, or a trading
algorithm making trades in the market. Events likes this are *discrete*
and often *structured*, such as JSON objects. This makes TrailDB different
from typical time-series databases that handle *continuous* data, like CPU
utilization which are suitable for aggregation.

TrailDB shines at compressing large amounts of discrete event data in a
small amount of space, which can be queried efficiently. For instance,
a TrailDB could include all actions by all users ever taken on your web
site, or granular event logs from thousands of servers -- all compressed
to a single, neat file which can be small enough to allow
analysis on a laptop.

TrailDB produces immutable files which your application can access
using the TrailDB library. The TrailDB library is implemented in C that
makes it extremely performant. Multiple language bindings are provided,
including [Go], [Python], [D], [Haskell], and [R].


# Why TrailDB?

It is easy to store and query series of events using existing databases.
What makes TrailDB different is immutability: Immutable data enables
deeper compression, scalability, and architectural decisions, which
would not be feasible with existing databases. This is especially true
for cloud environments with object stores like Amazon S3 that are a
perfect match for compressed, immutable files. Once in S3, TrailDBs can
be easily processed using an arbitrary number of servers in parallel,
without any centralized bottlenecks.

Developer productivity is another main motivation of TrailDB. Individual
files are easy to manipulate using standard filesystem tools. The easily
portable C library has only a handful of easily available dependencies,
making it easily deployable. [The API] is clean and minimal by design.
In Devops point of view, it is invaluable to be able to observe various
slices of a large data-intensive production system on a laptop, which in
the case of TrailDB is a matter of downloading a file.

TrailDB is used as a highly performant building block in large
production systems, so maintainability, reliability and robustness are
of central importance. The test coverage is nearly 100%. TrailDB takes
backwards compatibility very seriously: You should be always able to
read older TrailDBs using the newest version of the library.
